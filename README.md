## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - Redux
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - Promise based HTTP client

### What I learned

I use this project to have a big focus on react, redux, using APIs and improving look & feel technics.

Redux to store data and not calling API everytime I need to filter.

Partial SCSS to have organized styling in modules.


### Continued development

I want to get more in deep into Redux as it is a powerful tool to manage data into an application.
